          Jeffrey Pessina was born in Illinois, USA, and is one of ten children.
          At the age of twenty, after a long period of drug addiction and
          alcohol abuse, God changed his life. Five weeks after his decision to
          become a Christ-follower, he left for the Philippines to serve as a
          missionary. He met his wife, Rowena Pessina, in 1983. They married in
          1986 and have four grown children. In 1987 they incorporated the
          Philippine Frontline Ministries, Inc (PFM), an evangelistic team
          ministry that was then fully mobile, and traveled throughout the
          nation sharing the good news of Christ Jesus. In 2000, PFM moved to
          establish a mission center in San Pablo City, Laguna and branched out
          into other initiatives. Frontline now oversees a growing multi-site
          church (Frontline Worship Center), a program to protect and develop
          abandoned and abused children (Face the Children), a Christian school
          (Frontline Christian Academy, Inc.), and is involved in compassionate
          ministries to change the lives of the marginalized poor through social
          enterprise businesses and livelihood programs.

        <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-[2.3] text-justify">
          Frontline Christian Academy, Inc. (FCA) began initially as a home
          school for the staff children of the Philippine Frontline Ministries,
          Inc., (PFM). Later PFM decided to pursue solutions for abandoned and
          abused street children, and established a child care initiative named
          Face the Children (FTC). In line with this initiative, the strategic
          scope of FCA was expanded to meet the educational needs of the
          children being cared for under the FTC program.

          air-conditioned trailer, located in a small compound in Brgy. San
          Francisco, San Pablo City, quickly expanded. In 2007, FCA was moved to
          a more suitable, larger venue, in the same barangay. FCA was
          officially incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit educational
          institution in July 2009, and obtained the necessary permits from the
          Department of Education in 2011. FCA refers to 2009 as its official
          "first year."
