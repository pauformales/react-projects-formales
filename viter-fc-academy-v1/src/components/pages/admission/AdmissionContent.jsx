          Playschool is for students ages 2-4. It's a play-and-learn program
          without the pressure of formal schooling. Students learn communication
          skills, personal responsibility, real-life skills, creativity, music,
          and have nature experiences as they explore plants and trees... and
          even do some planting themselves! Basic numeracy and literacy is also
          integrated – learning phonetic sounds of the letters, and learning how
          to count and work with numbers.

          Elementary school is a special time in a child's life, where they
          embark on a journey of learning and discovery. They learn reading,
          writing, and basic math, and explore science, history, and the world
          around them. Caring teachers support their growth, and kids make
          friends and develop their creativity through fun activities like
          sports, music, and art. FCA provides a safe and nurturing environment
          where children can thrive and have fun, as well as grow in their faith
          and love for God and others.
